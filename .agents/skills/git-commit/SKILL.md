# Git Commit with Conventional Commits

## Overview

Create standardized, semantic git commits using the Conventional Commits specification. Analyze the actual diff to determine appropriate type, scope, and message.

## Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

| Type       | Purpose                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature                    |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                        |
| `docs`     | Documentation only             |
| `style`    | Formatting/style (no logic)    |
| `refactor` | Code refactor (no feature/fix) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement        |
| `test`     | Add/update tests               |
| `build`    | Build system/dependencies      |
| `ci`       | CI/config changes              |
| `chore`    | Maintenance/misc               |
| `revert`   | Revert commit                  |

## Breaking Changes

```
# Exclamation mark after type/scope
feat!: remove deprecated endpoint

# BREAKING CHANGE footer
feat: allow config to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key behavior changed
```

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Diff

```bash
# Check status and scope of changes
git status --porcelain

# If files are staged, use staged diff
git diff --staged

# If nothing staged, use working tree diff
git diff --stat
```

**Multi-feature detection:** If `git status --porcelain` shows changes across 3+ different areas (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`), **STOP and ask the user**:

- "You have changes across multiple areas. Commit all together, or split into separate commits?"
- Provide options: "All together", "Split by feature", "Interactive staging"

**Never auto-commit everything as one if changes span multiple unrelated features/modules.**

### 2. Stage Files

**If user wants to split:**

```bash
# Stage specific files/directories
git add src/auth/
git add src/ui/
git add tests/

# Or interactive staging for fine-grained control
git add -p
```

**If user wants all together:** Proceed with all staged files.

**Never commit secrets** (.env, credentials.json, private keys).

### 3. Generate Commit Message

Analyze the diff to determine:

- **Type**: What kind of change is this?
- **Scope**: What area/module is affected?
- **Description**: One-line summary of what changed (present tense, imperative mood, <72 chars)

### 4. Execute Commit

```bash
# Single line
git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>"

# Multi-line with body/footer
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>[scope]: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
EOF
)"
```

## Best Practices

- One logical change per commit
- Present tense: "add" not "added"
- Imperative mood: "fix bug" not "fixes bug"
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Refs #456`
- Keep description under 72 characters

## Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (--force, hard reset) without explicit request
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless user asks
- NEVER force push to main/master
- If commit fails due to hooks, fix and create NEW commit (don't amend)
